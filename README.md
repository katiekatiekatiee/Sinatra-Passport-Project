# Sinatra Passport

Welcome to your Virtual Passport! Here, you can create an account with your unique email address and a secure password that will allow you to access not only the passport entries you have created, but also the full list of countries that have been visited by all of the users in our database! Each entry you create is accompanied by a text description of any highlights or memories you want to document, the dates of the trip, and any spots you'd say are a "must-see," or places you don't think anyone should miss. This way, all of these memories and a log of the places you've travelled can be kept in the same safe space. You can only edit and delete entries you have created and, of course, ultimately log out when you are finished. 

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository in your terminal. 
Navigate into the file in the terminal and open it.

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Then enter the following into the terminal and view in your browser:

    $ shotgun


## Usage

Upon opening the file in a text editor, run "bundle install" to ensure the application's gem dependencies are met. Then, enter "shotgun" into the terminal to open a server and be able to view the application in your browser as "localhost."

From there, you will be directed first to the Home Page. Here, create an account if you do not have one by clicking the link to do so, or log in with your email and password. 

Once logged in, you can choose from a variety of options. A user can view all countries entered into the database, but the user can only view the descriptions and other post attributes if that post belonds to. Also, a user can only edit or delete any of their own entries. This is done by clicking the appropriate links/buttons. To create a new entry, click the link "Create Entry" and enter the desired information, submit the form, and see your addition to the list of entries!

To log out of the application, simply click the "log out" button in the navigation bar featured on every page. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
